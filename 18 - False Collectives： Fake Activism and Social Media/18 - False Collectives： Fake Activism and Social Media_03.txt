cooperate. Let's build community together because that's the power we have with
which we can change the world. Before I go, I'm just going to pick out one
authentic collective and show you the difference. The Sea Shepherd Conservation
Society. This is a collective organized by human beings to rescue living
intelligences older than the models that we have of time itself, older than the
universe, older than our idea of how old Earth is. These intelligences are so
irreplaceable that they're probably the single most valuable beings and places
on the planet. The Sea Shepherd Conservation Society is physically
intervening in the slaughter of whales by actually ramming their ships into
illegal whaling vessels, shutting them down, telling the whole world what
they're doing and taking part of the stain off of us because now with a
collective that's truthfully organized, it's organized for an authentic
beautiful purpose. What happens is we can then see that to be human means to
protect beautiful intelligent beings. And the Sea Shepherd Conservation
Society is one of the authentic collectives on Facebook that I want to
encourage you to absolutely support, copy their media, add your own
intelligence, cooperate with them. What they're doing is a bold example of the
power of human agreement in plain, simple understanding of the crucial
importance of our ecologies, the history of life on Earth, our capacity to
protect each other, our humanity, and our future. Now that looks like
activism and that looks like intelligence and that is something that our
children in the future will be proud of. We need a lot more of that kind of
collective. We need none of the other kinds, together, with and for each other
in the future of life on Earth. I thank you for joining me. Bye bye for now.
