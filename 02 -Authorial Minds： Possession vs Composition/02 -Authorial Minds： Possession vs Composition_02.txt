And they're not laying eggs of fictions.
They're very attentive to everything that's actually happening right here now.
We can learn something deep from watching the attention and care which they form nests
and relations and live in their world.
They don't have a lot of room for what they had and lost or what they might get later.
They're right here, right now, in the place that they are in the context, they're in a
living context.
We are too.
We're buried in a lot of overlays, but we can reach out together from those overlays
and back into nature, back into the living stream of time, remembering ourselves and
each other and the possibilities of our excellence.
Thank you for joining me.
Bye for now.
