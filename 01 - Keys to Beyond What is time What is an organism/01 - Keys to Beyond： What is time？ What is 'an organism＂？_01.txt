they want to tell us lots of fancy stories about things that they don't
deliver that they then that actually damage our intelligence and they sell
us back broken pieces of it at ever-increasing prices meanwhile the
parasites rise up on mountains of money power and blood while the common people
the living places the history of life on earth it's burned up it's burned up like
you know fuel to build that money that's got to stop now to start with I want to
help you understand why you're nothing like the stories you've been told you've
probably first of the main problem is that we have we have broken ideas about
central features of reality like time light what the Sun is what the world is
what an animal is what an ecosystem is what language is what intelligence is
what relation is in fact what separation is what unity is we have really
damaged ideas about all these things and part of the reason that they're
damaged is that just like when you compress a digital artifact like a
digital asset like a film or a video or a song over and over again and you use
bad compression you get artifacts in there right and if you keep doing that
compression pretty soon all that's left is the artifacts you don't have any of
the original content this is what's happened with most of our knowledge
ways and especially with our language there's something really astonishing in
our language I'm going to hint about briefly before I go on our languages on
on earth contain what I would analogize as the fossilized remains of contact
with some form of extremely advanced intelligence it's in all the human
languages you can see it I can show it to you and what it means is that a long
time ago when our languages were being developed we were trying to emulate
something just as you and I did when we learned language from our parents yeah
except the whole species was trying to emulate something vastly more intelligent
than anything we're currently aware of is existing I don't want you to think
about gods or space intelligences or anything like that I want you to realize
something really simple earth is like a concentrated crystal of the character
of space time what that means is everything that you see on earth is a
concentrated version of the basic how should we put it well just like if you
had salty water right and then you saw like salt crystals formed you took those
crystals out like wow that's really interesting it's a solid very
concentrated you know crystal and you taste it and it's salty yeah but you
wouldn't see that in the water right you can't see the salt in the water just
looks like water well earth is the same kind of crystal and so our intelligence
yours of mine is an instance of the intelligence of all of time space but
instead of delivering that to us we got such a tiny broken portion that we never
get any sort of experience of that and we have normally no way of contacting or
developing or allowing that to happen I intend to change that today and the
first thing I want to do is help you to correct one important idea time okay
what does it mean to be an organism how old are you how old am I how old is an
insect right so in order to help you see that we've got the wrong idea about time
I want you to think about time in a little bit of a new way I want you to
realize that each object that you can identify as distinct such as the stone
and each creature that you can see as being separate is actually an entirely
unique universe of time I'm gonna show you a little bit about how that works so
we've been told stories about the age of things by science for example science
tells us not science actually scientists right science doesn't have a voice
there's no such thing as science except as humans do it so when if I say science
tells us actually mean scientists tell us something scientists tell us that the
universe began about 14 billion years ago okay so that means like 14 billion
times of the earth going around the Sun one time and they think that the universe
began 14 billion years ago it's reasonable they think there was a big
bang they don't really know what that was and that everything came out of that
14 billion years ago and that our earth formed about 4.3 billion years ago and
that life on earth formed about 3 billion years ago all interesting numbers
here's the problem they're nothing like the truth let me explain why they're
wrong and they're absolutely catastrophically wrong the first part
of the problem is we can't actually make numbers that are anything like nature
it's impossible humans will never do it there's no computer on earth that could
help you understand the nature of the number that would represent the age of
the earth none none I'm gonna show you exactly why that's true in just a
moment what we call a year doesn't exist it doesn't exist except as an
abstraction there's no such thing as a year what they mean by a year is if you
have a human being on a planet like earth and you spin that around the Sun one
time you get one year which is approximately 12 months we know how
many approximately 365 ish days we can all understand that that's reasonable
but it's an abstraction because here's the problem earth never had one human
being on it and each individual object or being is an entirely unique domain of
temporality what that means is it's its own local universe of time now each
planet each stone each cell each organelle each virus each animal they all
have their own peculiar relationship with time that is sort of encapsulated
just for them no one else has experienced the year that you experienced
in your first year no one only you experienced that year other beings
related with you from their separate sort of or how should I put it not
separate but from their unique and distinguished positions in time but let's
look at the ramifications of this a little more closely because I want you
to understand just how old you are if you spin one human around the Sun one
time you get one human life here but what happens when you spin well right now
we've got seven billion of them well you get in one year that's seven billion
human life here's see the problem because already what we've got is more time
and that's where we've gotten nowhere into the depth of this run the very
surface of this idea right it's from the absolute surface of it nowhere can you
possibly a mat the earth isn't only three point five billion years old and
yet in one year we experienced seven billion human life here's so that's
twice the supposed age of the earth in one year just in separate human years
but here's the worst problem I mean it gets much much more deeper than this
think with me about this for a moment
each of those seven billion humans is a unique domain of time and what that
means is that when you have two of them together you get not only two human
life years but you get the relational domains of time between them and that's
not just one or two domains it's billions of domains and some of those
domains of temporality that connect those two humans are running at speeds
that are ridiculously faster than human time let me give you an example what
happens when you spin one cell around the Sun for one human life year's worth
of time well for a cell you might get I'm just gonna make up an arbitrary
figure because I can't do the actual math to tell you what the difference
between cells temporality and a human's temporality is but we can just watch a
cell and imagine that the speed of time for a cell has many factors over the
speed of time for a human so if you spin a cell around the Sun one time just one
