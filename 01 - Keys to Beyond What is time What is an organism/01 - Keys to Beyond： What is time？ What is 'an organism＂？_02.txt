cell you're probably gonna get the equivalent of about I'm just gonna kind
of make up a number as soon as the machines get done here
I have to compete with these right just to talk with you and we're losing this
competition you spin a cell around the Sun one time which probably gonna get
something like 500,000 cell years so and and while you're doing that that
cells gonna divide and become maybe thousands hundreds of thousands
millions of cells much like we ourselves might and so you're not just gonna get
one cell year or a hundred thousand cell years you're gonna get all of the years
of all of those cells and all of the relational time between them how much
time is that well it's so much time that you can't make a number about it
there's no way to possibly make a number about it and here's the thing if you
spend just one human okay around the Sun one time you get that one human life
here but the problem is you are 50 trillion animal cells and you are 500
trillion bacterial cells and all of the different ways that those relay so
in that one year you are more time than humans have ever imagined about any
number they've ever invented ever ever but that's still not the depth of it
because life began on earth at some point in history right and since then all
of the organisms on earth and all of their relations and all of their organs
and their cells and their mitochondria and their organelles and their bacteria
and their viruses have all been madly relationally being in time together and
so there was an origin of life on earth and that's been going on for about 3.5
billion flat years that we can count and while that's been happening life never
stopped so first of all your personal age is is is an expression a living
expression of that whole process which means number one even outside of the
exotic model I'm showing you here you're as old as life on earth so if you were
born on earth you start out 3.5 billion years old even in regular time you're
not one year old when you're one you're as old as life on earth whatever however
in whatever way you want to measure that yeah but then if you look at the the
mode of time that I'm talking about which is relational it's absolutely
factual you can see it right two humans going around the Sun one time is two
different human life years and the relationships between them and the
relationships with all of nature and everything so the first thing I want you
to see is you were conned you were told ridiculous stories about time that are
so incredibly dumb founding that they're almost impossible to escape into any
kind of intelligence the first thing I want you to realize is that you're
older than any number that's ever been made in so many different ways that you
could never finish exploring them and and just by seeing this you can see how
already the ways that we think about ordinary things like what is time what
is an animal when you're looking at an animal okay you're looking at something
billions of times the age of the universe why didn't science or religion
tell you that why didn't they show you the very simple fact that the way we
talk about time is a fiction and it's a deadly fiction because it implies totally
ridiculous things about how old we are and because we we can't understand how
old we are we can't understand what it means to be a human being or to be an
animal or to be a living world or what time space is really about because we're
just one planet in space but how many planets in space are there and for 4.5
billion years all of these planets many of which almost certainly have life
forms on them have been playing this astonishing game with time an organism is
to time okay as a sun is to light we're time stars we make billions of kinds of
time that we don't even have language that allows us to look into I'm trying
to give us some of that language now so the first thing I want you to understand
okay is that you're more astonishing than all of science and all of religion
right now right now you don't have to do anything you don't have to learn
anything more you have to be anything different just be yourself and forget
about the models of time that you were shown in human culture because they'll
destroy your intelligence once you realize that your actual age is so
astonishingly beyond the whole idea of time that doesn't even it won't even fit
inside science okay there's no religion that can contain this there's no
language that can that can express to you the unthinkable relational symphony
of billions and trillions of lives in mad furious relational development that
is just your single body right and think about the implications of this when
we when we get past this because I'm gonna need to go on to other topics the
first thing I just want you to understand it's very simple is you're older than
everything not by like 10 factors or a hundred factors you're older than
everything by a billion factors and if science ever tries to compare you to a
machine you know like like this pen and says like this machine can be
intelligent okay the weird thing about this machine is it doesn't have that
relationship to time at all and it never will it can't okay a machine is just an
object it's not relational because it's not relational it doesn't have that same
kind of time this is actually the actual age they say it is if this was built a
year ago this is exactly one year old if you were born a year ago you're older
than all the time humans have ever counted you will never be a machine your
brain is nothing like a computer has nothing to do with computation nothing
computation is a metaphor okay and it's the wrong metaphor for organisms
organisms do not have functions those are a fiction made up by people that
want you to think that you're an object you will never be an object these things
exist in flat time you exist in transcendental relational time luckily
now you have a little bit of an idea how astonishing this kind of time is and
how ridiculous the other kind is never believe the myth that machines have
anything in common with you I'll give you another example medicine if your heart
starts to die I can put an artificial heart in you okay and that might keep
your blood pumping and that might keep you alive no problem I get it but here's
the thing because your heart is living and it's forms of billions of organisms
and all those organisms are relationally intelligent and relationally
temporal in the way that we've discussed your heart has more functions than
science has numbers functions right in other words it does more kinds of
relational those actually those aren't functions that relations but it does more
kinds of relational super function then there are numbers to talk about it one
heart does that okay so when they put a mechanical heart in you that just pumps
blood what you get is a machine like this it has flat relational time relation
time age and it's not relational it does one thing and that's pump blood your
heart does billions of things think science will never discover in the next
10,000 years so to call the machine that they put in you a heart is completely
ridiculous right that would be like calling your mother I don't know what a
fork there's no way you could be born of a fork it has a function but it's not an
organism so you have nothing in common with machines and the people that want
to tell you that they're gonna build like an artificial intelligence they don't
know what intelligence is trust me they have not the slightest idea what they're
talking about our flat functions in flatly temporal a relational objects
over here with actual intelligence what you have is these time stars right that
