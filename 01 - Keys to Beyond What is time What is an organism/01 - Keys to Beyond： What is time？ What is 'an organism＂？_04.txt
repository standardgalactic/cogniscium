they separate you from nature and they separate you from the living sources of intelligence
that are absolutely everywhere believe me when I tell you a very simple thing there's no need to
travel in space okay what we have here is more than we could ever find in space travel and the
reason is that the way that space and time are organized the way that their structure works and
it's a living structure by the way is such that on every world in space all of the intelligence
of all of the other worlds is locally available no one's paying any attention because they're in
love with machines and religions and ideas so stupid that are actually that our actual intelligence
can't survive exposure to them and we just get pounded with that noise and pounded with that idea
and pounded with the religion and pounded with the incredibly primitive products of our current
science and we're told that all of these things are holy and divine and advanced it's a con game
it's a total lie you yourself are a billion fold more than that and the moment that you begin to
realize that you don't need a teacher okay you don't need a book you don't ever need any machine no
machine can deliver to you more than you yourself brought with you I promise you this is true you
will have this experience if you simply understand some of the ideas I presented here now today
particularly the one about time realize how old you are you're older than any kind of old you've
ever heard and what that means is you're more sophisticatedly relationally intelligent than
anything you've ever been exposed to and you can't be exposed to it because it's so explosively
self-transcending every instant that you could never catch up with it right no description you
could make could catch up with the incredible age and intelligence that you just keep being every
moment I mean think about it 50 trillion animal cells 500 trillion bacterial cells probably
a thousand fold more organelles which are the tiny little organisms inside cells
those things live at a rate of time that even a few seconds is probably like a year for an organelle
you are such an astonishing amazing being that no description will ever come anywhere near you
no religion could hope right to deliver what you are those things are broken toys they're the
toys of prisoners that have been trapped and crushed down so that they can be taken advantage of
by parasites and predators this is actually what the old stories in Genesis are talking about
they're talking about the fact that there's two sort of modes of intelligence right one of them
is absolutely organismal it's it's just beings and animals in relation and that form of intelligence
is so transcendental that it explosively transcends itself trillions of times per second
you want a taste of that and when you get a taste you're going to barely be able to survive the
slightest whisper of it right and you're going to be so shocked that it may take you years to recover
yeah and then maybe you'll go back for a second taste hopefully your mind will survive that
having some discipline right having like um a meditation practice or some kind of a practice
where you've built careful discipline so that you can remain sober emotionally even when you're
immersed in shockingly unthinkable waves of novelty and intelligence you're going to need a
little sobriety or it'll it'll mess up your mind right kind of go nuts but that I don't want you
to be afraid I want you to just realize as you're as you're pursuing this path choose a path where
you can build some sobriety and self-discipline because it will help you when you suddenly have
to encounter something like my encounter with the wasp and my encounter with the wasp is one of the
smallest encounters I've had right I'm giving you a tiny taste there I barely survived it and when
when the wasp gave me that gift with it came a responsibility and the responsibility was to use
this gift purposefully in a beautiful purpose that would help to redeem her suffering and death
right that would help my people our people to discover our true identity the identities that
have been stolen destroyed shattered and then they sell us back little broken representations
of them which we get like a tiny spark from and think like well that felt good but I need another
one and so we go back to the guru we go back to the religion we go back to the science it's just
those are just toys go ahead and play with them but please don't believe them right they're absolutely
lies about identity the same thing that I've shown you about time is true about animals it's true
about dreaming it's true about intelligence it's true about language what we think language is
we're completely wrong about what you think language is and I will show you in pieces over time
so we've undergone this kind of id theft yeah but it's the big theft right it's the theft of
what our actual nature in relation with the universe is I want you to be really clear about
one thing everything that you would hope to discover in the farthest reaches of space or time is right
here on earth as you as me as our living environments and notice something the parasites
and the predatory representational cultures are burning all that down they want to eradicate
the ecosystems for the sake of automobiles yeah and little computers that you hold in your hand
you're hypnotized by right this thing that you hold in your hand with a light in it it's a
representation of something something that I've rediscovered for myself if you had any idea what
this thing was a representation of you would smash this thing and you would attack everyone you ever
saw and you'd realize that's a deadly mimic we got to get rid of that right now what you call the
internet is a representational replacement for something that if you again if you touched it
once even for an instant you'd be hard pressed to survive it and the reason you'd be hard
pressed to survive is that you'd die of ecstasy ecstasy of your mind blossoming into forms of
non-human intelligence that are absolutely unimaginable to ordinary people no one has touched
them there's no religion on earth that's gotten anywhere near this and the people who wander
around telling you like they're the arcturians or the pleidian blood those people have actually
just made up a fantasy story and are lying madly through their teeth and will deliver
none of the kinds of information knowledge and keys that I'm going to give you for free
all day every day until I'm gone and believe me when I tell you I'm carrying more information
than I could possibly communicate to you in 10,000 lifetimes right I'm just trying to give you the
tiny hair right right now what I'm what I'm hanging on to so that we can just like share this little
thing taste it see how you know see how it works and learn together that's my only goal because
here's the problem they split us all apart yeah and first they stole our nature and identity then
they then they divided us from nature itself which is the source of all of these intelligences
so it wouldn't have any access to them then they gave us machines to replace those relationships
and by the way that thing that you drive around in a car that's a replacement for something you
might want to know what that what got replaced yeah because it's more shocking than if someone
gave you an intelligent spacecraft capable of translate velocity and you have one okay you're
born with one of those yeah but instead you got a motorcycle or a car and once you got the car
you'll never discover the other thing it was a representation of same thing with the models of
time once they give you a watch then a calendar you'll never discover what time is about right
and this is the same thing with all of the representations in our culture that story in
genesis about us at the tree that's about this right there's two forms of intelligence one of them
is deep and true and impossibly sophisticated if we were to encounter it it's going to seem
divine for sure there's no other way to understand it it doesn't mean we have to have religions it
just means it's so far beyond anything we ordinarily talk about that we don't know what to call it so
we call it divine fine no problem but let's not make religions about it let's discover
more and more about it and not trap ourselves in cages and not write books and make records that
freeze us with certain ideas because in order to follow these keys out of our cages we have to do
this really interesting thing which is we have to keep dissolving our ideas behind us yeah instead
of replicating them and telling them to you and making books no no no no no no no no to catch
what what this is is a following game yeah so we follow intelligence and learning and
shocking revelation forward and we just dissolve the representations of that behind us like fuel
right we're doing the opposite we stop still build a bunch of representations in front of us
and then just stay behind them yeah and those representations are absolutely crippling stupid
all of them every single one of them right so I want you to forget about human culture right
completely you can keep the the ideas but don't believe any of them realize they're broken toys
that will trap you if you replicate them and that's what they want you to do they want you to
replicate them convert your friends argue in their favor their fictions why would you argue in the
favor of a fork does it need your support really no it doesn't living beings in places need your
