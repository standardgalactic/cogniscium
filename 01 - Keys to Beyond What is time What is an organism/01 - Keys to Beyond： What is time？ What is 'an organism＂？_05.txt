support we need each other's intelligence so here's what I want to get at another way our
intelligence is stolen is by separating us from nature first and giving us machines instead
and then separating us from each other and giving us ideologies instead right science religion
gurus um you know the new age uh books and fictions and fandom and rock bands and sports
right that's hilarious they build teams to to to accomplish miraculous nothing and then people
get so excited they kill each other over it really really let me tell you what that's a
representation of okay in the same way that calendar time is nothing like living time most
of the things we do in culture are nothing like what we would do if we just had each other if we
just had a deep relationship with nature because there's no way we'll ever ever be able to exhaust
the depth of those things but I want to make one thing really clear nature doesn't have a purpose
nature is infinitely purposive it generates new forms of purposive beings and moments and
possibilities billions of times per second right so if you have a purpose you're broken
you're dead in the water you're going nowhere what you need is purposive inspiration
relational uh intimacy and intelligence yeah and the capacity to to form little family like
units with those assets and then chase them forward in the development that's what nature's
doing that's not what humans are doing humans build representations and stop there and they
burn down nature and intelligence to build up the representations and make those godlike see how
that works it doesn't work so here's the last thing that I want to give you um before I wind
this up thank you for staying with me so long if you have a truly noble purpose okay a purpose so
beautiful that all living beings would basically agree and then be like yes please that's worth
chasing right what kind of a purpose might that be well it might be just the purpose of nature
herself if your purpose matches natures she'll recognize you in a sense not that she's a she
but you can think of her that way the other thing I want you to understand is that earth is an
intelligence so sophisticated you're never going to find anything more sophisticated you don't have
to go to space forget about going to space you don't need to everything we need is right here
and it's right here in such shockingly profound abundance that we've just overlooked it and we
keep looking up at the sky and going like can I go up there can I go up there can I go up there
why don't you look at what's right here because what's right here is a concentrated localized
version of everything in all the time space all the possibilities of space travel are right here
on earth and we don't need to burn up anything or make any kind of machine to encounter those
directly to relate with them to become intimate with them to learn with them they are the living
beings of our world they are the living ecologies of our world and we've overlooked them entirely
and are burning them down to make machines to fly into space which we don't have to go there
to get any of the things that we think might be out there they are here that's the nature of time
space the last thing I want to say is this a small human group five people okay reconnected
with their actual intelligence reconnected with nature with a beautiful purpose reconnected
with each other right with the body of unity this is as if this was their purpose yeah these five
people reconnected in the old way free of human culture with some sense of the corrections and
ideas that we can encounter by learning these new ways together five people can change this planet
in a month and that's what everyone's terrified of that's why we have all the representations
five people can defeat any force that human culture has ever assembled and not just defeated
they could transform it they could turn the whole thing into an asset in a month that's how
powerful we actually are that's why all of the parasites and predators are constantly seethingly
at work to crush us down and the story in Genesis is kind of about this it's a key actually the
medicine is in that first story of the tree you don't have time to explain it here but understand
this there were two forms of intelligence right and one of them was authentic and natural and
transcendental and the other one was hypothetical and could make all kinds of little theoretical
divisions like science or like language itself when we tasted this one it changed how we saw
the world and our minds and we became actually kind of paranoid which is why we realized that there
was there wasn't so much that there was evil right but we realized that it was hypothetically
possible that something could be evil maybe we're evil and then we got really scared so apparently
something really funny happened they took the leaf of one of the only plants on earth
that has a microscopic flower you can't see its flower and they hid their genitals with that flower
because they were afraid that the divine universe of intelligence would see that they'd eaten from
the tree and they then saw that it might be wrong to be naked maybe we're supposed to be clothed
like in like the animals have fur yeah and so they tried to hide themselves yeah and they kept
hiding themselves and they kept hiding themselves and they kept hiding until our day today right
we're we're completely hidden in every possible way we're buried in deadly poisonous wrong
representations that cripple us destroy our intelligence and deny us our basic the basic
assets of our humanity the history of life on earth our true nature is living beings and they
compare us to machines i want to say one other thing there's no such thing as evil trust me
evil is a trick yeah it's a trick that was played by the representational aspect of our minds
which tends to be associated with our left hemispheres right side of our body this is the
hemisphere that actually rules all of our cultures and produces all the false collectives yeah that
we're struggling with it's not bad in and of itself we need to not not don't get mad at the
left hemisphere you just need to realize it's very dangerous when it's disconnected from its sources
in nature and transcendental intelligence i want to thank you for staying with me this long we're
going to learn way more amazing things than this but with this one key about how old you are and
how old any organism that you see is i want you to understand something very simple your mind is the
actual platform of perfect contact with all of the forms of intelligence on earth it's as if earth
invented the most exquisite possible communion element right and then put this in you so you
were actually a creature who evolved specifically to unify and magnify the entire ring of
intelligences on earth and those intelligences are more sophisticated than anything it's possible
to imagine and they're like if you could imagine standing in the center of the sun there are a
billion fold more productive than that relationally right we are something no one has ever been able
to tell us and it's so exciting that if any of us get any kind of a taste of it there's nothing
that can stand in our way we will be unstoppable beautiful and we won't make war we'll make
transformation in waves of unbelievably beautiful intelligence we will save our world we will
transform our cultures we will retrieve our humanity our intelligence and our power to form
little collectives that can accomplish miracles overnight we'll retrieve it instantly right the
moment that we stop believing all of the lies and broken models of identity that our language and
our culture and our science and our religion are pouring down on our heads constantly and telling
us we're advanced by the way science tells you you're made of stardust they're completely wrong
you are the expression of the living star that is our sun you're an organ of that sun the same
way this finger is an organ of my body okay you're not made of stardust they want you to
think you're a dead object right and they're telling you it's so exciting you're made of stardust
they're making you stupid okay and they're telling you that that's advanced it's the same thing in
religion they're telling like you're the divine child they never delivered any experience of that
what they gave you was a fantasy that your left hemisphere can cling to and pretend like this
will save me from being destroyed and from being evil there's no such thing as evil evil simply means
you got it backwards you bought the representation instead of inhabiting the organism that's all
right there's no mean judgment thing in the sky at death none what's going to happen at death
is actually an encounter with pure intelligence and that's going to be like a kind of a dreaming
experience but a thousand fold more powerful yeah and the reason that i know this is that
i've had this experience not once i've had it about 15 times yeah you don't have to be afraid of
death ever again there's no evil there's no such real thing as an afterlife either what there is
is so astonishing that none of the human stories can capture it and you want a taste of that and
you want to taste while you're alive don't wait for death okay when you've seen salmon swimming
up waterfalls which is totally impossible obviously to get back to their birthplaces
that's what happens to us at death but if you do the same thing while you're still alive what you
