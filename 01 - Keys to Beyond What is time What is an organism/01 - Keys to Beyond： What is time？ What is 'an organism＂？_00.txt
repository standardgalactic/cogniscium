Hi my name is Darren Stevenson. You can find me on Facebook under that name in
San Francisco. I also have a website called organelle.org where you can find
some of the fossilized remains of my developmental speculations and
experience and I write a blog at wondercloud.wordpress.com. I'm very
excited I'm a little nervous because I want to give you some keys to cages you
probably have never even known that you've been trapped in and it's not one
or two cages it's like 50 or 1000 or 100 and every single human person pretty
much lives and dies inside these cages and they never get out. They're cages that
are formed of the incredibly crippling ideas about who we are, what things and
beings are, what nature is, what space is, what time is, what it means to be alive
or human or intelligent or together and these stories are cripplingly
misfounded and we are all infected with them and we sort of force each other
into these cages and nobody's got the keys you're not gonna find them in
science you're not gonna find them in religion there's no book on earth in
which you're gonna hear what I'm about to tell you. The reason that I want to do
this is that basically I like to free prisoners every kind. I am not a book
author I'm not a guru I'm not a teacher I'm just an ordinary person I'm a living
animal I'm part of nature I'm not part of nature I am nature speaking okay and
so what I'd like to do today is give you some keys that will let you out of the
cages that we've been stuck in for a long time. In order to do that I need to
change your ideas about certain kinds of things. I need to for you to stop
thinking that science is advanced and I'll show you why it isn't. I need you
to stop thinking that religion is going to connect you to any kind of divine
beings or space intelligences because it's not and it doesn't it does the
opposite right it crushes our intelligence and I want you just to
basically leave all the ideas that you've heard about what things are in
human culture and gurus and any kind of junk that you picked up just leave that
the door okay it'll still be there when we're done you don't have to be afraid
you can pick it up later. What I want to talk about right now is to help you
correct some of the horrible identity theft that we've undergone okay everyone
knows what modern identity theft means it means someone gets your identity
credentials and they use them to steal from you yeah but there's a far more
vast kind of identity theft that's been going on for millions of human lifetimes
and it's the theft that happens when we believe the ideas that our culture
teaches us about what it means to be human what the sky is what the earth is
what the sun is what the moon is what an animal is what ecosystems are and mean
what money is what language is and does. We live in these cages that are so
crippling that actually and I promise you this is true you've never tasted even
1% of your intelligence and if you were to get a taste of even 5% you'd be so
shocked and astonished and ecstatic that you really wouldn't have any kind of
interest in human culture hardly at all and you'd realize that almost all of it
was a really poisonous prison game. I'm hoping that we're gonna learn that
together today and be able to step outside of it we can still play with it
right we just won't have to belong in it anymore we won't have to be trapped in
it we won't have to serve it and be destroyed by it anymore that's really
my hope. So to begin I want you to realize that we've been conned okay and
the con started as children there wasn't any specific conspiracy involved all of
our cultures are broken they're falsified collectives that have to
promulgate deadly poisonous ideas to keep us trapped inside them now in case
you think I'm lying right you can you can take something that we think is
noble science everybody most people think science is pretty noble but you can
look around and realize we've had 2100 nuclear explosions in the last 50 years
science has given us billions of machines that we're all competing against
and losing they gave us the technologies with which we're burning down the
ecosystems which are the source of our minds bodies and intelligences and I
don't mean their source in history okay living places are the sources of our
intelligence right now like the heartbeat is the source of your own life so when
you burn the ecologies down we become catastrophically stupid which causes us
to burn the ecologies down faster and pretty soon we're just falling off the
cliff of our own stupidity into death right we need to stop that science is
not your hero okay as a as a way of knowing it's blameless but when you
when you give it to human cultures that are so misguided that all they can do is
make lethally aggressive technologies with which we have to compete against and
perish that's not good okay religion has absolutely failed every one of the
things it promised okay it's given us not contact with divine intelligence it's
given us contact with insanity which is basically fantasy stories that we made
up that terrify us or that promise us nonsensical things that are never
delivered no history of any religion ever succeeded right look look at all the
promises they made and look at our world our world is a seething nightmare of
horror and none of the religion saved it not weird not one of them all those
gurus Eckhart Tolle and Terence McKenna and and you know Osho and whoever else
you want to name they failed none of them produced even one interesting student
or one interesting development that saved anything really but they made lots
of money lots and lots of money is not interesting right so our cultures are
actually kind of like slave owners yeah they're fictions that stand above us and
crush us down while promising to be our heroes we don't have democracy we have
prisons okay we don't have education we've got stupidity rampantly running
around destroying our children's intelligence so the really weird thing
is that human culture is filled with mimetic predators these are predators
and parasites that mimic heroes and divinity but deliver atrocity death
rape murder and destruction why is that well let's find out a little bit about
it I don't want to go too far in that because what I want to do is really talk
about something a lot more beautiful why is everyone so afraid that we have to
have all these things like why why are we what are we hiding something's being
hidden by all this stuff right somebody somewhere or something maybe our cultures
themselves are really terrified that we're gonna discover something beyond
all religion something beyond all of science something beyond all the stories
we have about what it means to be human alive intelligent what progress means
excuse me somehow something is scared that we're going to become free yeah
that we're gonna have the power of our human intelligence and agreement
together within for each other right funded by the history of life on earth
and organized for purposes so beautiful and astonishing but nothing can oppose
them yeah because that's the real nature of our humanity we've been we've been
deprived of all of this and we've been isolated into like little broken pieces
that fight each other and are confused when in fact we're connected yeah we're
not just connected we're one thing but we're not just one thing with all humans
we're one thing with everything so the first thing I want you to see is
something kind of simple we're not yet intelligent we have the capacity for
intelligence beyond anything you've ever imagined and I want you to have a taste
of that I intend to help you get one but our cultures want to keep us stupid and
